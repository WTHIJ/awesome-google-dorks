  `filetype:pdf s√©curit√©`
- Find pages linking to Wikipedia:  
  `link:fr.wikipedia.org`
- Look for open "directory listings":  
  `intitle:"index of /"`
- Find admin login pages:  
  `allinurl:"admin login"`
- Search specific credentials exposure:

## üîí Security Tips & Ethical Use

- **Always have explicit authorization before probing sites with dorks!**
- Use personal/private search windows or tools to limit footprint and avoid leaking intent.
- Combine with `site:` to restrict your queries and avoid scanning the entire web.
- Watch out for sensitive discoveries: **report responsibly** (responsible disclosure).
- Don‚Äôt download or exploit data found without consent; it's illegal and unethical.
- Try your dorks on test environments first to build confidence.

## üìà Boost Your Search Efficiency

- Combine multiple operators for pinpoint accuracy.
  - Example: `site:edu filetype:xls intext:email`
- Use quoted strings for exact match searches (‚Äúpassword list‚Äù).
- Exclude undesired results with `-`.
- Use `daterange:` for only recent results.
- Remember: Results may change as Google updates its index!
